#Description
I needed a device to be plugged into a USB port only when I wanted it to be, but I could not gain access to it or the USB port physically, I could only gain general proximity to it.

#Board Manufacturing
OSHPark, https://oshpark.com/, can be used to fabricate the board.  Simply upload the "BT USB All SMD.brd" and select how many you would like to have built.  OSHPak takes about 2 to 3 weeks to fabricate the board.  You will have to purchase 3 at a time.  When I last ordered the board it was $9.95 for 3.

A Stencil to mask solder paste can be create by uploading the "BT USB All SMD.brd" to OSHStencils, https://www.oshstencils.com/.

#Components
* RF22301, these cost about $20
* USB In
* USB Out
* EE2-3NUX I purchased mine from eBay for about $0.50 each.
* AMS1117 voltage regulator, cost about $1
* Pin headers for UART I had some laying around

As for the smd components I picked up some sample books of capacitors, transistors, resistors, diodes and the such with a verity of components from eBay.  So for me these pieces were less than a penny each.

# Note
Once you solder the RF22301 on to a board its there.  I have not been able to remove one from an old board.  

#Operation
I used nRF Connect, that I downloaded from the Google Play to connect and trigger the switch.
